      5 ## Project Overview
      6 
      7 Disney Bounding catalog - a website for finding Disney character 
        color palettes to guide clothing choices. Built with Next.js App 
        Router, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4.
      8 
      9 ## Commands
     … +15 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Created CLAUDE.md with the essentials: project context, dev commands (using
  pnpm), and the key architectural decisions (App Router, Tailwind v4 syntax,
  path alias, strict TypeScript). Kept it concise since this is an early-stage
  project — it can grow as the codebase does.

❯ Just to make sure you understand what we're building, tell me what the    
  purpose of this site is going to be and tell me where you think we should 
   get started (but don't add any files yet).                               

⏺ Based on the README, this is a Disney Bounding catalog — a site where people
  can look up Disney characters and see what colors to wear to "bound" as them.
  Disney bounding is dressing in everyday clothes that evoke a character's color
   palette without being a full costume.

  Phase 1 is character search with color guidance. Phase 2 adds user-submitted
  outfit photos for inspiration.

  Where to start

  I'd suggest tackling Phase 1 in this order:

  1. Data model for characters — Define what a character looks like (name,
  movie/franchise, color palette, maybe a reference image). Decide whether this
  starts as static data (JSON/TypeScript file) or needs a database from day one.
  2. Character listing page — A browsable page showing characters, likely with
  search/filter. This is the core of Phase 1.
  3. Character detail view — Show a character's color palette with enough detail
   to be useful when shopping (color swatches, maybe color names or hex values).

  The first decision point is the data source — are you planning to use a
  database/CMS, or start with a static dataset of characters and their colors?

❯ Great. Let's start off very simple and static for now, and we can grow    
  when needed. I want to start with an example character page. Let's start  
  with Ariel from Little Mermaid. Create a page specifically for Ariel      
  which includes all the information you think it needs. It's ok to         
  hardcode values for now, we'll refactor it as we discover the domain      
  model.

⏺ Created the Ariel page at /characters/ariel. It includes:

  - Movie name ("The Little Mermaid") as context
  - Character name as the heading
  - Color palette with three key bounding colors — each has a visual swatch, a
  color name, and a practical tip on what clothing piece it maps to:
    - Red for her hair
    - Lavender for her seashell top
    - Seafoam Green for her tail

  You can see it with pnpm dev and navigating to /characters/ariel. Everything
  is hardcoded as requested — we can extract patterns once we add more
  characters.

❯ I have an image of Ariel I want to put onto the page. Where in the        
  project structure do you want me to put it?                               

⏺ Put it at public/characters/ariel.png (or .jpg/.webp, whatever format it is).
  That way character images follow a consistent convention as we add more, and
  it'll be accessible at /characters/ariel.png in the browser.

❯ I have added it to that location as a webp image. Can you show it on the  
  page you made earlier?

           Mermaid</p>
      26        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Ariel</h1>
      27  

⏺ Done. Added the image at the top of the page using Next.js's Image component
  for automatic optimization. You may need to adjust the width and height values
   depending on the actual dimensions of your image — those just control the
  rendered size.

❯ Good enough for now. Next, I want to consider the fact that Ariel has an  
  alternative princess dress outfit. People who disney bound as Ariel may   
  want to use the colors of her dress. Can you add another section to her   
  page with new colors for her dress outfit?

⏺ Done. The page now has two sections:

  - Mermaid — the classic look with red, lavender, and seafoam green
  - Princess Dress — her pink sparkly dress with a light blue bow/trim, keeping
  the signature red hair

  Each section is labeled by outfit name rather than "Color Palette" so it's
  clear which look you're going for.

❯ How should I restructure the image files so I can include an image of her 
   dress too on the page?                                                   

⏺ I'd suggest making public/characters/ariel/ a directory instead of a single
  file:
  public/characters/ariel/
    mermaid.webp
    princess-dress.webp

  That way each outfit gets its own image, and it scales naturally if more
  outfits are added later. You could move your current ariel.webp to
  ariel/mermaid.webp.

  Want me to update the page to reference the new paths once you've moved the
  files?
  /var/folders/v4/8mbblx3x25z2k8p9_0gssvtm0000gn/T/claude/public-characters-arie
  l.sh (ctrl+y to copy)

❯ I just added the image and changed the code to use it. Now I want to      
  start refactoring, as we have some duplicated UI code. Create a component 
   for a character's outfit that we can reuse throughout the site.

⏺ Created app/components/Outfit.tsx that takes a name, imageSrc, imageAlt, and
  colors array. The Ariel page now uses two <Outfit> instances instead of
  duplicated markup. The rendered output should be identical to what you had
  before.

⏺ Created app/characters/rapunzel/page.tsx with her iconic tower dress outfit.
  She has one outfit for now with three colors: gold (hair), lavender (dress),
  and pink (lacing accents).

  When you're ready, drop an image at
  public/characters/rapunzel/tower-dress.webp and it'll show up on the page. You
   can visit it at /characters/rapunzel.

Session 2 - /commit

Refactored hardcoded character pages (Ariel, Rapunzel) into a data-driven
architecture:
- Created app/data/characters.ts with Character, Outfit, OutfitColor types
  and static data for Ariel and Rapunzel
- Created app/characters/[slug]/page.tsx dynamic route using generateStaticParams
- Deleted app/characters/ariel/page.tsx and app/characters/rapunzel/page.tsx
- Updated app/components/Outfit.tsx to import OutfitColor from shared data file

Session 3 - Homepage character listing

> Let's make the homepage list all of the characters we currently have. We should show the character's name, their picture, and movie they are from.
