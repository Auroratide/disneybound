Last time we set up Pocketbase in docker so that we can start allowing people to upload pictures to the disney bounding website. Most of that setup is in the pocketbase folder. Consult the COMMUNITY_UPLOADS_PLAN.md file for a plan you composed for this feature. You completed Step 1 last time. Let's continue with Step 2: Install the SDK and wire up the client.

How should we go about writing tests for the newly added fetching of community outfits?

---

Write the component test first.

Continue with step 5

Generally speaking, every API route should be accompanied with testing. What do we need to do to write a test for our new api route?

---

I actually don't want you to mock pocketbase. Let's rely on the pocketbase that is running locally for testing against. But yes, go ahead with implementing node-based tests and these test scenarios.

---

We shouldn't be putting the superadmin credentials into the .env file, because I don't want nextjs to be loading them. Is there another way to load the superadmin credentials into tests?

---

How about this: let's create a setup test file which vitest runs (one for API, one for components) and simply hardcode the two env variables in there. It's simple, and since it's local pocketbase the credentials aren't sensitive. For the component setup, we can execute the afterEach(cleanup) thing so we avoid needing it in every test file.

Let's proceed with Step 6 of the COMMUNITY_UPLOADS_PLAN.md. However, what I want you to do is first create a test for the form component first, then pause and let me review it. Do not write the form implementation until I've reviewed the test.

---

go ahead with the implementation
