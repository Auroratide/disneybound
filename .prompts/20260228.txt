Let's fix a bug. I can see the list of approved community outfits now, but the images are broken. Please find why.

---

Here, let me give you what the DOM has: [img element with srcset pointing to /_next/image URLs for http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/pbc_3576859721/f4i38tjs9z1s8b6/poooper_n1xs1gzusp.png]

---

When I try to go to the _next/image url, I get: '"url" parameter is not allowed'

---

Is there any risk in production with allowing this? It does say "dangerously" in the name.

---

/commit

---

Continue with Step 1

---

I see that community-outfits.test.ts is failing. Probably has to do with records needing a user now.

---

I cleaned it up myself. Let's commit.

---

I have a question about Step 2. I see it says `pocketbase/migrations/005_configure_smtp.js` — Configure PocketBase SMTP settings to point at Mailpit. If you're making a migration to point to Mailpit, how is this going to work in production once production exists?

---

Can you show me what the migration would look like?

---

Ok I understand now. Let's continue with Step 2.
