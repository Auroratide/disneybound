Let's fix a bug. I can see the list of approved community outfits now, but the images are broken. Please find why.

---

Here, let me give you what the DOM has: [img element with srcset pointing to /_next/image URLs for http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/pbc_3576859721/f4i38tjs9z1s8b6/poooper_n1xs1gzusp.png]

---

When I try to go to the _next/image url, I get: '"url" parameter is not allowed'

---

Is there any risk in production with allowing this? It does say "dangerously" in the name.
