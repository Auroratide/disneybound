User: Last time we added support for search/filter of disney characters. I want you to look at the code for it and tell me what you think about its accessibility and wcag compliance.

User: Let's focus on the label and live region. Modify the tests first.

User: Use getByLabel, that will force the implementation to have an accessible label.

User: Do not use sr-only. Wcag wants labels to be in general visible. Plus, it's actually useful for sighted people to see how many characters were found.

User: yes

User: yes

User: Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Integrate shadcn/ui

## Context
The project uses vanilla Tailwind CSS v4 with minimal hand-written component styles. The goal is to adopt shadcn/ui to get a more polished, consistent visual foundation while retaining full control over the markup and styling.

## Approach

### 1. Initialize shadcn/ui
```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```
- Choose **New York** style (more refined, suits a visual catalog)
- Choose **Zinc** base color (neutral, won't fight the per-character card colors)
- This will:
  - Add CSS variable definitions to `app/globals.css` (merging with existing `--background`/`--foreground`)
  - Create `lib/utils.ts` with the `cn()` helper
  - Add dependencies: `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`

### 2. Add components
```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input card badge
```
- `Input` → replaces the hand-rolled search input in `CharacterGrid`
- `Card`, `CardContent` → wraps each character tile in the grid
- `Badge` → for the movie name label on character cards

### 3. Update `CharacterGrid.tsx`
**File:** `app/components/CharacterGrid/CharacterGrid.tsx`
- Replace `<input>` with shadcn `<Input>`
- Replace the `<Link>` wrapper + inner divs with `<Card>` / `<CardContent>`
- Use `<Badge variant="secondary">` for the movie name

### 4. Update `Outfit.tsx`
**File:** `app/components/Outfit/Outfit.tsx`
- Wrap outfit section in `<Card>` / `<CardContent>` for consistent surface treatment
- Color swatch items stay as-is (they rely on dynamic inline styles)

### 5. Verify
- `pnpm test` — all 9 existing tests should still pass (shadcn components render as the same semantic HTML elements)
- `pnpm lint` — no new lint errors
- `pnpm dev` — visual inspection of homepage and character page

User: I just ran the install command myself since it seems you ran into an error. Proceed with the next step.

User: I'm getting this error in the app: "CssSyntaxError: tailwindcss: /Users/auroratide/Projects/disneybounding/app/globals.css:1:1: Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css'"

User: Let's make the Outfit cards look better. Right now they look sloppy because the image just sort of appears over the colors. Can you organize the card so that it looks better? Additionally, I want to utilize the outfit background somehow. My theory is it'll look cool if instead of a straight background color, we can make it like three overlapping circles, vaguely mickey head shaped, with the image on top of it.

User: For the image, try using three radial-gradients on one div instead of styled divs. This will allow us not to need to crop the image.

User: I made some of my own adjustments since the syntax you used was wrong for the gradient. It's not perfect but we can adjust as we make this better. Now I want to address mobile. The colors and image do not fit side-by-side on mobile. Lets make it vertically laid out when on a mobile-sized screen, but horizontal like it is now on a desktop-sized screen.
