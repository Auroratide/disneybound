User: Last time we added support for search/filter of disney characters. I want you to look at the code for it and tell me what you think about its accessibility and wcag compliance.

User: Let's focus on the label and live region. Modify the tests first.

User: Use getByLabel, that will force the implementation to have an accessible label.

User: Do not use sr-only. Wcag wants labels to be in general visible. Plus, it's actually useful for sighted people to see how many characters were found.

User: yes

User: Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Integrate shadcn/ui

## Context
The project uses vanilla Tailwind CSS v4 with minimal hand-written component styles. The goal is to adopt shadcn/ui to get a more polished, consistent visual foundation while retaining full control over the markup and styling.

## Approach

### 1. Initialize shadcn/ui
```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```
- Choose **New York** style (more refined, suits a visual catalog)
- Choose **Zinc** base color (neutral, won't fight the per-character card colors)
- This will:
  - Add CSS variable definitions to `app/globals.css` (merging with existing `--background`/`--foreground`)
  - Create `lib/utils.ts` with the `cn()` helper
  - Add dependencies: `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`

### 2. Add components
```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input card badge
```
- `Input` → replaces the hand-rolled search input in `CharacterGrid`
- `Card`, `CardContent` → wraps each character tile in the grid
- `Badge` → for the movie name label on character cards

### 3. Update `CharacterGrid.tsx`
**File:** `app/components/CharacterGrid/CharacterGrid.tsx`
- Replace `<input>` with shadcn `<Input>`
- Replace the `<Link>` wrapper + inner divs with `<Card>` / `<CardContent>`
- Use `<Badge variant="secondary">` for the movie name

### 4. Update `Outfit.tsx`
**File:** `app/components/Outfit/Outfit.tsx`
- Wrap outfit section in `<Card>` / `<CardContent>` for consistent surface treatment
- Color swatch items stay as-is (they rely on dynamic inline styles)

### 5. Verify
- `pnpm test` — all 9 existing tests should still pass (shadcn components render as the same semantic HTML elements)
- `pnpm lint` — no new lint errors
- `pnpm dev` — visual inspection of homepage and character page

User: I just ran the install command myself since it seems you ran into an error. Proceed with the next step.

User: I'm getting this error in the app: "CssSyntaxError: tailwindcss: /Users/auroratide/Projects/disneybounding/app/globals.css:1:1: Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css'"
