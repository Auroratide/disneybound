User: Last time we added support for search/filter of disney characters. I want you to look at the code for it and tell me what you think about its accessibility and wcag compliance.

User: Let's focus on the label and live region. Modify the tests first.

User: Use getByLabel, that will force the implementation to have an accessible label.

User: Do not use sr-only. Wcag wants labels to be in general visible. Plus, it's actually useful for sighted people to see how many characters were found.

User: yes

User: yes
